Frontend Individual Task 1: Build a Simple Movie Browser App
Imagine you're working as a frontend developer intern at a company building entertainment applications. They're looking to create a simple movie browser app to allow users to discover new movies and explore their details.
Goal:
Your task is to develop a user-friendly movie browser app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
Requirements:
Movie Search: Integrate a search bar that allows users to search for movies by title.
Movie Listing: Display a list of movies with relevant information like title, poster image, and release date. You can use a free movie API (e.g., TMDB API) to fetch movie data.
Movie Details: When a user clicks on a movie, display a detailed view with additional information like plot summary, cast, genres, and user ratings (optional).
Optional Features:
Genre Filtering: Allow users to filter movies by genre (using the API's genre data).
Watchlist Functionality: Implement a "watchlist" feature where users can add movies they're interested in watching (using local storage or cookies).
Basic User Interface (UI) Effects: Incorporate subtle animations or hover effects to enhance user experience (using CSS or JavaScript).
Deliverables:
A well-structured HTML file with clear semantic markup.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style the app layout, movie listings, and details page.
Functional JavaScript code for user interaction, search functionality, data fetching from the API (if used), and optional features.
A well-commented codebase that demonstrates good coding practices.
Resources:
Explore free movie APIs like TMDB API that provide movie data and images.
Consider using online resources like Bootstrap or Materialize for pre-built UI components (optional).
Deployment:
Deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or any other free or paid platform you know!
